Sentiment Analysis using LLAMA-2

This project performs sentiment analysis using LLAMA-2, a Python-based tool. You can use the following steps to set up the project:
Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine.

    shell

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory.

shell

cd <project_directory>

Install the required Python packages using pip.

shell

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Pre-Requirements

Before running the requirements.txt file, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

    Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from python.org.

    Create a Virtual Environment: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

        For Python 2:

        shell

python -m venv venv

For Python 3:

shell

    python3 -m venv venv

Replace venv with the desired name for your virtual environment.

Activate the Virtual Environment: After creating the virtual environment, activate it using the appropriate command:

shell

    source venv/bin/activate

Now, you're ready to run your project within the virtual environment, and the required dependencies are installed.

Feel free to replace <repository_url> and <project_directory> with the actual URL and directory name of your project.
